Github
Github is a web application allow us share & put out things in a central remote control in simple word it's 
collaboration tool.it also tell us if we change our code even the line.There is also storing data as snapshot of 
the project over time in different versions we change some file name in every version.There is also three main sections 
of a git project . The working tree :- it is a folder that we code on it.
                 . Staging area :- it is that we change something i have to stage.
                 . Git directory(Repository) :- it is what is tracked by git.
I also see some commits. We can see what we realse, add and the date.
